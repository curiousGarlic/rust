# COMMON PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS

## Variables and Mutability

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value.

Even though compiler errors can be frustrating, they only mean your program isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet.

In addition to allowing this value to change, mut conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing this variable’s value.

Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable.
